# Java Multithreading Simulations

## Overview

This repository contains two Java multithreading projects: a theater booking simulation and a flight boarding simulation. These projects demonstrate practical applications of Java's concurrency features in real-world scenarios.

## Theater Booking Simulation

Simulates a theater booking process with patrons arriving, booking seats, and being guided to their seats. Key components include:

- **`Seat`**: Represents theater seats.
- **`Patron`**: Simulates patrons booking seats.
- **`TicketCounter`**: Manages booking processes.
- **`Usher`**: Guides patrons to their allocated seats.
- **`TheaterSimulation`**: Orchestrates the entire simulation.

## Flight Boarding Simulation

Models airline check-in and boarding with passengers arriving, checking in, and boarding a flight. Key components include:

- **`Passenger`**: Represents passengers checking in and boarding.
- **`CheckInCounter`**: Handles check-in processes.
- **`FlightAttendant`**: Manages passenger boarding.
- **`FlightSimulation`**: Oversees the entire boarding process.
